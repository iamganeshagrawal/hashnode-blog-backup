## Hello World!

A **“Hello World!”** program is often used as a simplistic introduction to programming languages, as it’s generally quite self-explanatory, and simple enough that even those with little or no programming experience can understand its function. However, do not mistake its simplicity for a lack of utility. The program needs a functioning language compiler and run-time to accomplish its task. This makes it ideal for a quick and easy sanity test for new systems.

I remember when I started writing codes about a couple of years ago, the very first thing I learned was the famous hello world statement which is sure its the same across all languages.

> Despite the myth that “Hello World!” is the first thing to be output by all computers, its prevalence in nearly all facets of technology is undeniable.

Getting started in programming is quite fun and the best part is you can write codes at any age! wonderful right? Maybe you can get a little confused at the initial stage regarding what language is the best for you to learn. But believe me, after some time you are going to enjoy typing every single line of code and their outcomes.


> Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.” - *Stephen Hawking*

As they say, the best time to start is now, don't procrastinate, as long you have the passion and determination their nothing difficult to learn.


```c
// "Hello World!" in C

int main(){
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}

``` 

Language maybe is different but "Hello world!" always be there for showing you the richness of that language.

```javascript
// Simple NodeJS Server Application with "Hello World!"

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Express app listening on port ${port}!`))
```

There is no better way to start programming than to start. The most recommended thing is to learn the basics, and for this, the best thing is to rack your brains trying to make a concrete project or an application that you want to create or develop. Having a specific goal helps a lot.


> **TL;DR** - It has been a long one and remember to *keep reading code, keep writing code, do not forget to try what it does*. Once comfortable in a language, moving on to the next will be easier and will bring you new skills.


`Ufff!` In this "Hello World!" myth I forgot that this is actually my first post here, so I have to introduce myself to you or maybe it's my own "Hello World!".

## About Me
Hello! my name is Ganesh Agrawal. If you want to know more about me you can see [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamganeshagrawal/), you must be new here, so I decided to write my first post talking a little about my motivations to have a blog.

I intend to share the knowledge that I have been acquiring as a way to validate, memorize, and help other beginners who are going through the same problems and doubts.

Also, I am thinking about post web development tips mainly, a little bit of theory about what I've been studied in my academic life, reviews of technology books, events, courses, and whatever else comes to mind.

So that's it, feel free, pour yourself a coffee, and wait for new posts to exchange ideas about the world **`dev`**.
